# queue-dsa-using-array
queue data structure implementation using array java
This is a simple Java program that implements a **Queue data structure** using an array. It supports essential queue operations such as **insertion, removal, peeking, and size checking**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Enqueue (insert)** elements into the queue.
- **Dequeue (remove)** elements from the queue.
- **Peek the front** element without removing it.
- **Check if the queue is empty or full**.
- **Display all elements** in the queue.
- **Retrieve the number of elements** in the queue.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java
- Scanner (for user input)

## 📂 Project Structure
```
QueueArray.java       --> Main queue implementation
README.md             --> Project documentation
```

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-queue-array.git
```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd java-queue-array
```
3. Compile the Java file:
```bash
javac QueueArray.java
```
4. Run the program:
```bash
java QueueArray
```

## 💡 Sample Output
```
What is the size of this queue: 3

Enter number 1 to store in this queue: 10
Enter number 2 to store in this queue: 20
Enter number 3 to store in this queue: 30

10 is inserted into the queue
20 is inserted into the queue
30 is inserted into the queue

Removed element: 10
Front element: 20
Queue is empty: false
Queue is full: false
Elements in this queue:
20 30

Number of elements in this queue: 2
```

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Convert this into a **Circular Queue** to prevent wasted space.
- Add **dynamic resizing** when the queue is full.
- Implement **priority queue functionality**.
- Integrate **file input/output** to save and load queues.
